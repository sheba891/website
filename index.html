                </div>
             <p> Web design is a profession where a person designs a web page or a web site. 
                The web page can have graphics, music, animations, and many other things on it. Some web design is done for businesses, 
                and some is done for individual people. 
                Some web designs are used a lot and have standard templates that are free for people to use.</p>

             <p>
                Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something somehow new and somehow valuable is formed. 
                The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object 
                (such as an invention, a printed literary work, or a painting).</p>
