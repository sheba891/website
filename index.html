              Web design is a profession where a person designs a web page or a
              web site. The web page can have graphics, music, animations, and
              many other things on it. Some web design is done for businesses,
              and some is done for individual people. Some web designs are used
              a lot and have standard templates that are free for people to use.

              Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something somehow new and
              somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible
              (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a
              joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a printed
              literary work, or a painting).

          A client is a computer or a program that, as part of its operation, relies on sending a request to another program or 
          a computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server (which may or may not be located on another computer). For example, web browsers are clients that connect to web servers and retrieve web pages for display. Email clients retrieve email from mail servers. Online chat use a variety of clients, which vary on the chat protocol being used. 
          Multiplayer video games or online video games may run as a client on each computer. 
          The term "client" may also be applied to computers or devices that run the client software or users that use the client software.
